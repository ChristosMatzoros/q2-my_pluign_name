## Installation



## Functionality


## Dev environment
This repository follows the _black_ code style. To make the development slightly easier
there are a couple of pre-commit hooks included here that will ensure that your changes
follow that formatting style. Before you start working on the code, please
install the hooks by executing `make dev` in your conda environment. From then on,
they will be run automatically every time you commit any changes.
